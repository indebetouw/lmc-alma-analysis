tw: examined the 30dor_cube_n13cubeerr.fits.gz file which shows a funny saw-tooth image histogram.  This seems to be a result of the 8K floor on Tex.  Larger Tex values seem to produce smaller errors, leading to the secondary histogram to the left.  Also, the linear approximation breaks down at larger values of T13, causing n13cubeerr to be lower than the error derived by the rms method.

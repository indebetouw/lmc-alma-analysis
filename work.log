tw: examined the 30dor_cube_n13cubeerr.fits.gz file which shows a funny saw-tooth image histogram.  This seems to be a result of the 8K floor on Tex.  Larger Tex values seem to produce smaller errors, leading to the secondary histogram to the left.  Also, the linear approximation breaks down at larger values of T13, causing n13cubeerr to be lower than the error derived by the rms method.
jb: alignment of images in reproject is producing small errors in the mask (blanked region) which leads to small differences in flux.  May be related to the interpolation scheme.  Convolve in Python is systematically offset from IDL convolve (looks like a multiplicative factor).  However the difference is small.  Will join the Github repository to get access to LTE calculations.
ew: Adding siglte and error to table; making new property correlation plots.
Next week: Go over property plots including siglte, set up dendrogram runs for archival data.

Feb 16:
jb: lte.py script seems to work, need to reorganize directory structure.  Continue with run_scimes.py (doscimes_gmc225.py) to generate property plots.  Simplify align+convolve+plot.py to just do the convolve and plot steps.

Mar 2:
ew: updating prop_hist to automatically select limits and bin size, allow subsets of structures to be plotted, set up calling script in pcc/pyscript.
tw: run new calling scripts on 30 Dor.  Update PCC results using 6-10 K Tfloor in noisegen.  Make moment maps for 2.5" resolution cubes when ready.
jb: smooth 30Dor and PCC flat cubes to 2.5" resolution and place results in '2p5arcsec' folder in Box.  Finish scimes run on GMC225.

Mar 28:
jb: 3 arcsec smoothing of 30Dor and PCC; some new data sets will need noise flattening first.  Set up python and sourcetree environments on mmwave account.
ew: continue working on prop_hist to improve x and y axis labeling, generating linewidth histogram that includes both clouds (for poster).

Apr 4:
jb: continue developing align+flatten+smooth scripts, some datasets need only smoothing whereas others also need alignment and flattening (like GMC104).  Smoothing script should have flexibility to smooth to a user-specified resolution or to a second image.

Apr 11:
Plan for GMC1:

1) Flatten both 12CO and 13CO images
2) Using 13CO as template, reproject the 12CO to match.
3) Using 13CO as template, smooth the 12CO to match => get 1st pair.
4) As a separate test, smooth both 12CO and 13CO to 3" resolution => get 2nd pair.
5) Regenerate moment maps (mom_gmc1_flat.pro):
  % idl
  IDL> mom_gmc1_flat
  IDL> exit
5) Try running LTE script on both pairs.
